# Modularis üåå

## What is Modularis? 
Modularis is a library of reusable React components designed to provide a consistent and flexible UI across multiple web applications.

## Motivation
The goal of Modularis is to:

- Promote consistency in UI design

- Enable code reuse across projects

- Reduce development time and maintenance efforts

By offering a shared set of components, Modularis helps teams avoid rebuilding the same UI elements in every project.
